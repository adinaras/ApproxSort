Approximate sorting and modified binary search

The implementation of the approximate sorting and modified binary searching algorithms can be found here. 

The command to run is 
./exe n aT D

where, n is the number of elements, aT is the average number of times to run to get average time and D is the factor maximum number of comparisons.
